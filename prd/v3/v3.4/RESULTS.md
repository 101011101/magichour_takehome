# v3.4 — RESULTS

**Status: open.** Evidence for [EXPERIMENT.md](EXPERIMENT.md); the matrix is [TEST.md](TEST.md).

## 1. Link A — the ankle cut removed, on the failure set (2026-08-31)

**Run.** fal `fal-ai/flux-2/klein/4b/distilled/edit`, not the A100 — the reviewer's call for
a small set. One reference call per garment (22), the cut applied or not as a
post-process, so `V` and `Vnc` share every pixel except the feet; 31 pairs × 3 seeds × 2
arms = 186 edits, 0 failures, ~$3.1 fal-equivalent. Runner `v3/build/run_v34_linkA.py`,
outputs `v3/runs/v34/linkA/`, page `v3/report/v34_linkA.html` (the A100 v3.3 output the
reviewer scored is the third column, for orientation; fal and the A100 are not
seed-identical, so the comparison of record is `V` vs `Vnc` *within* this run).

The cut fired on 16 of the 22 references; on 6 (`queen_latifah`, `g015`, `g029`, `g030`,
`p004`, `p014`) the reader found no ankles — partial crops or hidden feet — and `V` = `Vnc`
there by construction.

### 1.1 Result — no failure class moves

| class | pairs | `V` vs `Vnc` at the output |
|---|---|---|
| F1 wearer's clothing survives | 9 | **identical failure**: the kimono sleeves, hat and bag, `g004`'s olive trousers, `p001`'s jeans are there in both. The reference's feet have nothing to do with the wearer's sleeves |
| F2 skirt / dress → trousers | 8 | **identical**: zendaya's wrap skirt is trousers on Hugh, `p015`, `p025` in both; the slip dress on `g005` splits in both |
| F3 reference drift | 12 | **identical** on colour and pieces — the drift is in the regeneration, upstream of the cut |
| F4 exposed skin | 2 | identical |

What the cut *does* change, on a handful of cells: **footwear.** With the feet left in
the reference, the reference's shoes transfer where the wearer's own were kept before
(`peacoat + g030`'s boots, `g004 + g005`'s sneakers); with the cut, the wearer's shoes
stay. Neither was scored as the failure on those cells. Nothing else differs to the eye
across the 93 cell-pairs.

### 1.2 Reading

- **The ankle cut is not a cause of any v3.3 failure.** It stays in the lock as adopted
  (§9.2 of v3.3): safe, and now shown neutral on the failure set as well as on the fold.
- **The footwear question is a product decision, not a defect**: cut = wearer keeps their
  shoes; no cut = the reference's shoes come along when the model takes them. Either is
  defensible; the lock chose the former.
- The failures are where the taxonomy said: F1/F2 on the person side, F3 in the
  regeneration. Link A closes the one reference-side suspicion that was cheap to test.

*A side observation, not a result:* several cells differ visibly between the fal run
and the A100 run of the same prompt and seed (`g014 + g029`: the blazer over the blue
dress on the A100, a long coat on fal) — the backend variance of v3.3 §13 again, and
another reason select-from-N is the first real link.
